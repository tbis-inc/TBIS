Just as steel changed the building industry forever, Titanium will usher in a new era of network construction. With TBIS’ proprietary Company as a Service™ (CaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), every device, from enterprise level on down, can be virtualized; routers, firewalls, and specialized equipment such as cryptocurrency miners, can exist in an entirely cloud-based environment based on the decentralized Ethereum blockchain. Paired with cutting-edge enterprise management and monitoring technology, this will create a shock-proof internet infrastructure that will be both lightweight and completely revolutionary in scope. Imagine being able to set up an enterprise level infrastructure for a global company from a tablet in your living room, without spending any time installing rack servers, routers, load balancers, or any other network component beyond what is needed to access the network.
<h2><strong>The Future Is Now!</strong></h2>

Unlike typical infrastructure services, where a company’s technology may exist on up to several hundred devices, the Titanium infrastructure will reside on the decentralized Ethereum blockchain, which is composed of over 20,000 nodes, with each node potentially being composed of several hundred discreet systems. Even if several thousand nodes experienced a system failure, there would still be zero outage time, and perhaps, only a performance degradation of the Titanium services being delivered.
