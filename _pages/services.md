Just as steel changed the building industry forever, Titanium will usher in a new era of network construction. With TBIS’ proprietary Company as a Service™ (CaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), every device, from enterprise level on down, can be virtualized; routers, firewalls, and specialized equipment such as cryptocurrency miners, can exist in an entirely cloud-based environment based on the decentralized Ethereum blockchain. Paired with cutting-edge enterprise management and monitoring technology, this will create a shock-proof internet infrastructure that will be both lightweight and completely revolutionary in scope. Imagine being able to set up an enterprise level infrastructure for a global company from a tablet in your living room, without spending any time installing rack servers, routers, load balancers, or any other network component beyond what is needed to access the network.
