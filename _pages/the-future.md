<p style="text-align: center;">Unlike typical infrastructure services, where a company’s technology may exist on up to several hundred devices, the Titanium infrastructure will reside on the decentralized Ethereum blockchain, which is composed of over 20,000 nodes, with each node potentially being composed of several hundred discreet systems. Even if several thousand nodes experienced a system failure, there would still be zero outage time, and perhaps, only a performance degradation of the Titanium services being delivered.</p>
