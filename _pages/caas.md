<strong>Company as a Service (CaaS)â„¢:</strong>

This is an automated wizard which will allow a user to start a new business from square one through leveraging the power of Smart Contracts. Anyone who has attempted to start a business in the past is aware of the challenges presented by meeting legal requirements to establish a business.

<strong>Through CaaS, TBIS will be able to supply entrepreneurs with the critical support they need to get their business off the ground by completing tasks such as:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Registering for Business Licenses</li>
 	<li>Creating Business Bank Accounts</li>
 	<li>Filing Trademarks and Patents</li>
 	<li>Incorporating</li>
 	<li>Leasing of office space or equipment</li>
 	<li>Hiring employees or independent contractors</li>
 	<li>Securing advertising space</li>
 	<li>Domain registration and host acquisition</li>
</ol>
From a legal standpoint, these Smart Contracts will save business more than just time in the creation of businesses. Smart Contracts, encoded in the immutable TBIS Blockchain, cannot be tampered with or altered in any way. Once a contract has been signed, it has been etched into Titanium and will exist in perpetuity.
