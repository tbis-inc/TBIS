&nbsp;

&nbsp;

4.5 You agree that you shall have no further claims against the Company in respect of your support of the Network and/or the Token Sale in respect of any support, contribution or advice provided to the Company or Released Parties save for as detailed in this Agreement and that receipt of N Tokens will constitute full performance of any promises, representations, contracts or statements made by the Company or any Released Parties in respect of the same.

&nbsp;

4.6 If we have not received the payment of the full Price to Our Wallet within 24 hours of the time that you receive the payment instructions, we reserve the right to void your purchase request and refuse to accept your purchase of Tokens. For the avoidance of doubt, the Price will be deemed to be paid in full once we have received three (3) network confirmations of the transaction. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify any of the timelines described herein to account for network congestion or other technical challenges.

4.7 You must pay the Price by sending the correct quantity of ETH to the unique address displayed to you via the sale portal. Your purchase is not guaranteed until we receive the entire amount of the Price.

4.8 The Price must be paid to Our Wallet within 24 hours of execution of this Agreement.

4.9 Tokens will be paid into Your Wallet from Our Wallet within 6 weeks after the closing of the Token Sale.

Possible Migration of Tokens

4.10 Tokens are being created as ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum protocol. We reserve the right to migrate the ERC-20 based Tokens (Pre-existing Tokens) to another protocol and to generate replacement Tokens on the new protocol (Replacement Tokens) in the future, should we determine, in our sole discretion, that doing so is necessary or useful to the operation of the Network.

4.11 Should we decide to migrate the Tokens, we may no longer provide support for the Pre-existing Tokens relating to the Network except with respect to the migration process. Although we do not at this time anticipate that it will require any Pre-existing Token Holders to convert their Pre-existing Tokens to Replacement Tokens, we anticipate there will be significant incentives for Pre-existing Token Holders to do so, since the practical utility of Pre-existing Tokens will likely diminish rapidly once the Replacement Tokens are created and in use by a significant portion of Network participants. Accordingly, you acknowledge and agree that in order for you to continue to participate in the Network or obtain utility from the Tokens you may need to convert the Tokens you purchase during the Sale to Replacement Tokens in the future.

4.12 Should we decide to migrate the Tokens, we will notify you via the email address you provided to us at the time of the Sale. You are solely responsible for updating us should your contact information change.

4.13 You also understand and accept that as the Contribution may be smart-contract based, the functions, terms and conditions applicable thereon are set forth in the smart contract system existing on the Ethereum blockchain Smart Contract System (SCS). Furthermore, no other document or communication may

&nbsp;

modify or add any additional obligations or covenants for the Token Issuing beyond those set forth in these Terms.

4.14 You agree that you shall have no further claims against the Company in respect of their support of the Network or the Token Sale in respect of any support, contribution or advice provided to the Company or Released Parties save for as detailed in these Terms and that receipt of your Tokens will constitute full performance of any promises, representations, contracts or statements made by the Company or any Released Parties in respect of the same.

Contribution Software

4.15 Contributions in ETH must be made by using the SCS or to such other address we specify to you in writing herein or on our Sites (Contribution Software). Any Contribution in ETH to us without using the Contribution Software will not lead to a recommendation for Token allocation as set forth below.

4.16 Tokens will only be issued on behalf of the Token Issuing Entity during the Availability Period as specified in writing by us in these terms or on the Site. To the extent that any third-party website, service or smart-contract offers Tokens during the Availability Period or facilitates the allocation or transfer of Tokens in any way during the Availability Period or at any time up to Network launch, such third-party websites or services are, unless explicitly mentioned on the website specified above, not authorized by us and have no relationship in any way with us. We shall not be liable for you making any transfers of value to a wallet that is Our Wallet as specified by us in writing.

Contribution timing and thresholds

4.17 Block Time Delay: You are aware that, due to Ethereum block time delay, the exact time of the end of the Availability Period cannot be guaranteed.

4.18 Contribution Freeze / Abort: During the Availability Period, we may at any time stop the contribution function for technical, legal or security reasons. As long as such contribution freeze is upheld or if the Availability Period is aborted, no further Contribution will be possible.

4.19 You must ensure that you do not Contribute directly from an address provided by a cryptocurrency exchange service provider.

4.20 You are responsible for ensuring that the address used for your Contribution is fit to handle return functions and particularly, must ensure that you do not Contribute directly from an address provided by a cryptocurrency exchange service provider: failure to do so, may lead to your loss of this ETH (pursuant to your intended Contribution) - this also applies in event that your Contribution is not accepted by the Contribution Software for any other reason.

*Contribution Information: *

&nbsp;

4.21 Relevant information relating to the Contributions made during the Availability Period shall be recorded by the Contribution Software (Contribution Information).

4.22 Upon a successful Contribution having been made, the Contribution Information will reflect the quantity of Tokens to be allocated to the Contributor in proportion to their Contribution.

*Issuance of Tokens *

4.23 The creation and allocation of Tokens by are initiated by the Contributor sending ETH to the SCS, which triggers a smart contract operation. The SCS creates and allocates the corresponding Tokens to Your Wallet. Contributors shall ensure that they make a Contribution using an ETH address with which the Contribution Software can operate.

Token Functionality

4.24 Tokens are only intended for use in connection with the Network under the various applicable terms that shall be implemented when the Network is ready for use.

4.25 The exact functioning of Tokens on the Network shall only be determined once the Network is developed and fully operational and subject to any applicable terms of use of the Network.

4.26 Ownership of Tokens carries no rights express or implied other than the right to use Tokens as a mean to enable usage of and interaction with and within the Network, if the network is successfully completed and deployed.

Risk Factors

&nbsp;

1. SOME MATERIAL RISK FACTORS

1.1 Contributors are aware of the many risk involved in the purchase, use and sale of tokens and the token sale process. We have outlined below some of the material risks that are obvious to the Company and persons involved in the Token Sale and Network project (including Released Parties):

1.2 Early Stage Technology. The Token will be used to develop a Network that is based on or in some way involved with distributed ledger technologies (DLT). You understand and accept that the use of DLT Tokenized stores of value is highly experimental. Participation in the proposed Token Sale and Network project therefore represents a very high risk to Contributors. The Token Issuing Entity will invest in software and other technologies and that in all cases these technologies and businesses will still be in an early development stage and unproven, and there is an inherent risk that the software, technologies and related businesses invested in by the Token Issuing Entity could be unfit for their intended purpose and/or not have the value expected.

1.3 Cryptocurrency. The Token Issuing Entity may wish to store or convert cryptocurrency contributions into one or more fiat and/or alternative cryptocurrencies and there could be significant difficulties in making and managing such cryptocurrencies and funds including relating to the lack of ready convertibility between fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies and Tokens and the difficulty in being able to deal with such assets via traditional market counterparties and intermediaries. If the value of cryptocurrencies fluctuate unfavorably during or after the Token Sale, we may not be able to fund development, or may not be able to develop or maintain the Network in the manner that is intended. In addition to the usual market forces, there are several potential events which could exacerbate the risk of unfavorable fluctuation in the value of cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to another DAO-like attack on the Ethereum network; or significant security incidents or market irregularities at one or more of the major cryptocurrency exchanges.

&nbsp;

1.4 Main Protocol. Many of the Network project technologies including the Token will, at least initially, be based on the Bitcoin and the Ethereum protocols. Any malfunction, breakdown, forking or abandonment of these protocols may have a material adverse effect on the Network or the Tokens. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present fundamental risks to the value of such protocols and the Network.

1.5 Risk of software weaknesses: You understand and accept that the Network and the Tokens, the Contribution software and other involved software and technology and technical concepts and theories are still in an early development stage and unproven, and there is no warranty that the process for receiving, use and ownership of Tokens will be uninterrupted or error-free and there is an inherent risk that the software, Network, Tokens and related technologies and theories could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the partial or complete: loss of Tokens; inability to use Tokens; and/or lack of usefulness of Tokens.

1.6 Risk of blockchain mining attacks: You understand and accept that, as with other public blockchain based systems that depend upon independent miners, the Network may be susceptible to mining attacks including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, "selfish-mining" attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Network, expected proper execution and sequencing of Tokens transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of software computations.

1.7 Risk of loss of your credentials: You understand and accept that if your Wallet credentials are lost or stolen, the obtained Tokens associated with the Contribution will be unrecoverable and will be permanently lost. A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of Tokens stored in your Wallet. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your Wallet will result in loss of such Tokens. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted Wallet service you use, may be able to misappropriate your Tokens. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the Wallet you choose to receive and store Tokens, including your own failure to properly maintain or use such Wallet, may also result in the loss of your Tokens. Your failure to precisely follow the procedures set forth herein for buying and receiving Tokens, including, for instance, if you provide an incorrect Wallet address, or provide an address that is not ERC-20 compatible, may result in the loss of your Tokens.

1.8 Cybercrime. The acquisition and management of cryptocurrencies and Tokens is inherently subject to the risk of cybercrime that is difficult to manage and mitigate. This may result in concerted attempts and even successful attempts to hack the Network, Token Sale and the Sites and software used to

&nbsp;

manage contributions received in respect of Tokens and other software or technology components and to defraud Contributors and the Token Issuing Entity. The Token Issuing Entity and the Token Sale may be subject unauthorized access, hacking and/or theft of some of cryptocurrency and Token assets and it may not be possible to successfully insure against the same at a reasonable price or at all. The Token Issuing Entity is not required to insure the assets of the Token Issuing Entity and does not intend to insure the same. Any unauthorized access or cybercrime may result in theft or loss or inability to access Contributions, impacting the ability to issue Tokens and/or develop and launch the Network.

1.9 Failure or Abandonment. The Token Sale event itself or the Network project may be fully or partially abandoned or required to be re-structured for a number of reasons or remain technologically or commercially unsuccessful, or be shut down for many reasons including e.g., lack of interest from industry and/or the public, changes in law or regulatory issues, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects (e.g. caused by competing projects). There is no assurance that any Tokens or rights to Token acquired by Contributors will have the value expected or any value at the time of realization. You therefore understand and accept that the Contribution and/or the allocation, use and ownership of Tokens, carries significant risks that could lead to the Tokens being unusable or valueless.

1.10 Regulatory risk: You understand and accept that DLT and blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction and that it is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on, or introduce new regulations addressing, blockchain technology based applications, which may be contrary to the current setup of the Contribution process and which may, inter alia, result in substantial modifications of the Network, including potential loss of Tokens for the Contributor. Further, the Contributor accepts and bears risks with respect to US, China, Canada -regulations that may regulate Contribution and/or potential custody of Tokens including for US, Chinese, Canadian persons. The Token Issuing Entity or any Group Company may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.

1.11 Risk of uninsured losses: Tokens do not represent deposits and are not subject to any statutory or private insurance unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by the Company to offer recourse to you.

1.12 Risk of governance failure: Tokens confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the Network or the Company, all decisions involving Company’s products or services or that of any subsidiary company within the Network or the

&nbsp;

Company itself will be made at Company’s sole discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to discontinue its products or services on the Network, or to sell or liquidate the Company. These decisions could adversely affect the Network and the utility of any Tokens you own.
