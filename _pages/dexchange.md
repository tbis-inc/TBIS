<strong>DEXchange™</strong>

Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies are centered around decentralization. However, many cryptocurrency exchanges of today are based on centralized systems which are controlled by outside entities. The Titanium DEXchange will provide initial support for the top twenty (20) fiat currency pairs used worldwide, and allow for exchange trading with the top two-hundred (200) cryptocurrencies as per <a href="https://www.coinmarketcap.com">Coin Market Capitalization</a> in an entirely decentralized fashion. Of course, Titanium reserves the right to increase or decrease the number of fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies it supports with future releases of the product. DEXchange will also guarantee the lowest transaction fees on the planet as well.
