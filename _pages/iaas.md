<strong>Titanium Infrastructure as a Service</strong>™ <strong>(IaaS) ~ Product Details</strong>

The core competency objective and primary goal of TBIS is the creation and propagation of a shockproof distributed network infrastructure capable of replacing the bloated and inefficient hardware foundation upon which the internet of today is based. <em>In essence: to build a better internet that cannot be controlled or destroyed by anyone and is open for all.</em>

<strong>This will include but is not limited to:</strong>

<strong> </strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Maintaining and Enhancing TBIS’ existing enterprise virtualization software package which enables the creation of network components such as servers, routers, switches, , in a distributed environment</li>
 	<li>Building and remaining as the <em>de facto</em> platform for creating, maintaining, patching and upgrading distributed enterprise IT environments</li>
 	<li>Making it quick and simple to virtualize entire enterprise-level infrastructure environments while simultaneously decreasing the cost-to-consumer and downtime while increasing network reliability, security, and convenience</li>
 	<li>Website hosting through the Titanium Virtual Server System will be more reliable than existing shared hosting because unlike a traditional server, which can go down, the TBIS servers will guarantee constant uptime and dramatically increased security</li>
 	<li>Implement the cutting-edge TBIS Enterprise Management Software with autonomous healing and security functions include in the Titanium Hydra Fault Tolerance Suite for all monitored elements and network components</li>
</ol>
