Today, Phore announced that Michael Stollaire, CEO and founder of Titanium Blockchain Infrastructure Services (Titanium) will be joining the Phore project as a Technical Advisor.

Mr. Stollaire already serves as Technical Advisor to three other blockchain projects; Electroneum, HTMLCoin and Bounty0X.

These partnerships will help achieve more decentralisation, efficiency and mass adoption of services delivered on the blockchain.

“This is another positive step towards achieving my “drain the swamp” initiative. These partnerships will form an alliance of forward-thinking companies with a real-world use case, and when continued and expanded, will force the negative influences out of the blockchain community, whilst simultaneously forcing mass-adoption of blockchain technology to occur.” said Stollaire.

Mr. Stollaire’s experience in network infrastructure services and blockchain technologies brings value to each project and collectively as the decentralized systems are deployed. While there are currently many great infrastructure services capabilities across both traditional cloud and decentralised services, these partnerships serve to increase the ability to offer a real and extremely competitive alternative to the current ‘enterprise’ strength cloud/virtualization world.
