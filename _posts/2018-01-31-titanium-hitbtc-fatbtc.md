After an extremely successful ICO, where the 35,000,000 BAR hard cap was reached over one month ahead of schedule, we are excited to announce our initial exchange listings.

<em>In the near future, the Titanium BAR can be purchased on <a href="https://hitbtc.com/">HitBTC</a> and <a href="https://www.fatbtc.com/">FatBTC</a>.</em>

<strong>What is Titanium and what are BARs?</strong>
