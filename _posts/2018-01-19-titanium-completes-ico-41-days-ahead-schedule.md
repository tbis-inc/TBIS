We have reached our hard cap of 35,000,000 BAR in just 18 days! Due to extremely high demand, we have sold out of BAR tokens more than 1 month ahead of schedule!

We would like express our tremendous thanks to the Titanium community for their amazing support. This process has exceeded our highest expectations and serves as an incredible validation of our project.

Now that the ICO has been fully funded, our hard-working team will begin taking the next steps toward building a world-class company.

We will be rapidly moving forward to add more staff, setup new headquarters, and deliver our core product, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

We will continue to develop our recently announced partnerships with ETN, HTMLCoin and Bounty0X, as well as seeking new partnerships, with the goal of helping unite the blockchain community.

We will also be doing a Q&amp;A in Telegram over the next week. Please join our <a href="https://t.me/TbisOfficial">Telegram group</a> to keep up to date with the latest developments.

<h2><strong>FAQ</strong></h2>

<strong>Q: I still haven’t received my BARs, when will I get them?</strong>
Right now, our team is processing thousands of transactions. If you have sent us your payment then please, just wait! We are working hard to send out all of the BARs as soon as possible.

<strong>Q: When do I get my referral tokens?</strong>
Now that the ICO has concluded, our team will begin calculating referrals. It may take a few weeks to send out the referral payments.

<strong>Q: I didn’t get my bonus! When are you sending it?</strong>
Bonuses were included in the price of your purchase request, and were sent in the same transaction as the BARs you ordered. There is no separate transaction for bonuses.

<strong>Q: When will I receive my T-Shirt / Gear Box / Deluxe Gear Box?</strong>
Our top priority is processing transactions and making sure everyone who participated in the token sale received their BARs. For those of you who qualified for a gear box – we haven’t forgotten about you! We will be contacting you to confirm your shipping addresses, so please watch for that email.

<strong>Q: What is the final market cap of BARs in circulation?</strong>
While the total number BAR in existence will be 60 million, the BARs in circulation will be significantly less than that. Even though the ICO has officially ended, we have a lot of work ahead of us. Once all transactions have been processed, we will be able to more accurately estimate the BAR circulation, and will announce this information publicly.

<strong>Q: How do I buy tokens?</strong>
The ICO has concluded. In the future you will be able to purchase tokens on the secondary market.

<strong>Q: When will tokens be listed on exchanges?</strong>
We cannot legally comment on exchanges at this time. Rest assured that we will use our knowledge and experience to do the best for our community. We will make an official announcement sometime in the coming weeks.

<strong>Many thanks and much love from the Titanium Team!</strong>
